# 2. STRUCTURAL & FORMATTING AI TELLS

These are patterns in how AI organizes content, not just what words it uses.

---

## 2A. Cookie-Cutter Introductions

**The Problem:** AI almost always opens with a broad, generic context-setter before getting to the point.

**AI Pattern Examples:**
- "Menopause is a natural biological process that affects millions of women worldwide..."
- "In today's fast-paced world, managing your health has never been more important..."
- "Hot flashes are one of the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting up to 75% of women..."
- "[Topic] is something that [broad statement about audience]..."

**The Fix:**
- Start with a specific moment, feeling, or scenario
- Start with a surprising fact or statistic (not a generic one)
- Start mid-thought, like you're already in conversation
- Start with a question that isn't rhetorical fluff
- Write the whole piece first, then delete the first paragraph. The second paragraph is almost always the real opening.

**Before:** "Menopause is a natural biological process that every woman will experience. Understanding the symptoms can help you manage this transition more effectively."

**After:** "3 AM. Wide awake again, sheets soaked, heart racing. You know it's not anxiety. You know exactly what it is."

## 2B. Cookie-Cutter Conclusions

**The Problem:** AI wraps up with a neat summary bow that restates everything already said.

**AI Pattern Examples:**
- "In conclusion, menopause is a complex but manageable experience..."
- "By understanding your symptoms and taking proactive steps, you can..."
- "Remember, every woman's experience is unique, and there are many resources..."
- "Ultimately, the key is to [restate the entire article]..."
- "[Topic] doesn't have to be [negative thing]. With the right [approach/tools/mindset]..."

**The Fix:**
- End with a forward-looking thought, not a summary
- End with a single actionable step
- End mid-thought or with a question that lingers
- End with something specific and personal, not a greeting-card sentiment
- Just stop when you're done. Not every piece needs a "conclusion."

## 2C. Perfectly Parallel Structure

**The Problem:** Every section follows the exact same format. Same number of bullet points, same sentence structures, same section lengths.

**AI Pattern:**
```
## Section 1: [Topic]
[2-3 sentence intro]
- Point A (one sentence explanation)
- Point B (one sentence explanation)
- Point C (one sentence explanation)
[1-2 sentence wrap-up]

## Section 2: [Topic]
[2-3 sentence intro]
- Point A (one sentence explanation)
- Point B (one sentence explanation)
- Point C (one sentence explanation)
[1-2 sentence wrap-up]
```

**The Fix:**
- Vary section lengths wildly. One section can be 3 paragraphs. The next can be 1 sentence.
- Mix formats within a piece: paragraphs, a short list, a quote, a single-line callout
- Not every point needs the same depth of explanation
- Let some sections breathe and others be punchy

## 2D. Over-Structuring with Headers

**The Problem:** AI breaks content into tiny, over-organized sections with H2s and H3s for everything, even when the content flows better as continuous prose.

**The Fix:**
- Blog posts: Use headers for genuine section breaks, not every sub-point
- A 1,000-word article doesn't need 8 headers
- Some content reads better as flowing paragraphs with no headers at all
- Use headers for scanability where it helps, not as a structural crutch

## 2E. The Listicle Default

**The Problem:** AI turns everything into "X Ways to..." or "Y Tips for..." or numbered lists when the content would be better served by narrative, storytelling, or essay format.

**The Fix:**
- Ask: does this topic genuinely benefit from a list format?
- Mix list posts with narrative posts, personal essays, Q&A formats, myth-busting formats
- When you do use lists, don't force a round number. 4 tips is fine. 11 is fine. It doesn't have to be 5, 7, or 10.

## 2F. The Colon-List Combo

**The Problem:** AI loves the pattern of a sentence ending in a colon followed by a bulleted list.

**AI Pattern:**
"Here are some ways to manage hot flashes:"
- Stay cool
- Dress in layers
- Avoid triggers

**The Fix:**
- Weave information into paragraphs instead
- When you do use lists, vary how you introduce them
- Not every set of related points needs to be a bulleted list

---

# 3. SENTENCE, PARAGRAPH & PUNCTUATION PATTERNS

---

## 3A. Uniform Sentence Length

**The Problem:** AI writes sentences that are almost all the same length (typically 15-25 words). Human writing has dramatic variation: 3-word sentences next to 30-word sentences.

**The Fix:**
- After generating, read it aloud. If every sentence feels the same rhythm, rewrite.
- Intentionally include very short sentences (1-5 words) for emphasis
- Let some sentences run long and complex when the idea demands it
- Vary sentence openings (see below)

**Before (AI):** "Hot flashes can occur at any time during the day. They typically last between one and five minutes. Many women find them more intense at night. There are several strategies that can help manage them."

**After (Human):** "Hot flashes don't check your schedule. They hit in meetings, in the middle of dinner, at 2 AM when you just want to sleep. Most last a few minutes. Some feel like they last an hour. And the night ones? Those are a different beast entirely."

## 3B. Repetitive Sentence Openings

**The Problem:** AI starts multiple consecutive sentences or paragraphs with the same word, especially: "This," "It," "The," "Many," "Some," "These," "There are."

**The Fix:**
- Scan your content for paragraph openings. If 3+ start the same way, rewrite.
- Start some sentences with verbs, some with prepositional phrases, some with the subject
- Start a sentence with "And" or "But" occasionally (it's fine, despite what your English teacher said)
- Fragment sentences are allowed: "Worth trying."

## 3C. The Topic Sentence Formula

**The Problem:** Every AI paragraph begins with a mini-thesis statement, like a high school essay.

**AI Pattern:** "Managing stress during menopause is crucial for overall wellbeing. Research shows that cortisol levels..." [thesis, then evidence, then wrap-up, every single time]

**The Fix:**
- Start some paragraphs with evidence first, conclusion second
- Start some paragraphs with a story or anecdote
- Start some paragraphs with a question
- Let some paragraphs just continue the thought from the previous one without a fresh thesis

## 3D. Restatement Padding

**The Problem:** AI restates the same point at the beginning and end of each section, saying it twice in slightly different words.

**AI Pattern:** "Sleep disruption is one of the most frustrating symptoms of menopause. [3 paragraphs of content] In summary, sleep difficulties during menopause can significantly impact your quality of life."

**The Fix:**
- Cut every in-section summary. The reader literally just read it.
- Trust your reader to have absorbed the point the first time.
- End sections on a new thought or transition, not a recap.

## 3E. Over-Explaining the Obvious

**The Problem:** AI explains things your audience already knows because it defaults to writing for the broadest possible audience.

**AI Pattern:** "Menopause is a natural biological process that occurs when a woman's ovaries stop producing eggs and her menstrual cycles end permanently, typically between the ages of 45 and 55."

**The Fix:**
- Your audience is women experiencing menopause. They know what menopause is.
- Skip definitions for terms your audience lives with daily
- Jump to the insight, the new information, the thing they haven't heard before
- Add this instruction to your prompt: "The reader already knows what menopause is. Do not define it or explain basic concepts."

## 3F. Em Dash Overload

**The Problem:** AI uses em dashes constantly, often multiple times per paragraph. While em dashes are legitimate punctuation, AI overuses them as a default "connector" for asides and parenthetical thoughts.

**The Fix:**
- Limit to 1 em dash per article (or 1 per 500 words max)
- Replace most with periods, commas, or parentheses
- Sometimes just start a new sentence instead
- Add "Do not use em dashes" to your prompt if the problem persists

## 3G. Parenthetical Aside Overuse

**The Problem:** AI adds clarifying asides in parentheses constantly, as if the reader needs hand-holding through every sentence.

**AI Pattern:** "Perimenopause (the transitional period before menopause) can begin years before your last period (typically in your 40s, though it can start earlier)."

**The Fix:**
- If the aside is essential, work it into the sentence naturally
- If it's not essential, cut it
- Max 1-2 parenthetical asides per article
- Your audience doesn't need constant definitions

## 3H. Uniform Paragraph Length

**The Problem:** AI writes paragraphs that are all roughly 3-4 sentences long. Human writing varies wildly: 1-sentence paragraphs, 6-sentence paragraphs, all mixed together.

**The Fix:**
- Use 1-sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- Let some paragraphs run 5-6 sentences when exploring a complex idea
- Vary paragraph length within a piece the same way you vary sentence length

---

# 4. TONE & EMOTIONAL AI TELLS

---

## 4A. General Tone Problems

**Performative Agreeableness:** AI never disagrees, never takes a strong position, never says "actually, that's wrong." It hedges everything with "while some people find..." and "there are many perspectives..."

**Fix:** Take a stance. Have an opinion. "This supplement is overhyped and the research doesn't support it" is better content than "While some people find this supplement helpful, results may vary."

**Overly Polished:** AI text reads like it was edited by a committee. No rough edges, no personality, no quirks. Everything is smooth and professional to the point of being forgettable.

**Fix:** Leave in some conversational roughness. Sentence fragments. Starting sentences with "And." The occasional aside that shows personality.

**Relentless Positivity:** AI wraps everything in an optimistic bow, even when the topic is genuinely difficult or painful.

**Fix:** Acknowledge that some things are just hard. "Night sweats suck" is more honest and relatable than "While night sweats can be challenging, there are many strategies to help you thrive."

## 4B. Health Content Specific Tone Problems

**Too Clinical / Detached:** Reads like a medical textbook. Correct information, zero warmth.

**Example:** "Vasomotor symptoms, commonly referred to as hot flashes, affect approximately 75% of perimenopausal and menopausal women. These episodes are characterized by sudden feelings of warmth."

**Fix:** Keep accuracy, add a human voice. "About 3 out of 4 women going through menopause get hot flashes. If you're one of them, you already know the drill: the heat rising out of nowhere, the sudden need to rip off every layer."

**Performatively Empathetic:** AI tries to sound caring but comes across as a chatbot reading a script.

**Example:** "We understand how challenging this time can be. You deserve support and compassion as you navigate this important life transition."

**Fix:** Show empathy through specificity, not through declaring empathy. Don't say "we understand." Instead, describe the experience accurately enough that the reader thinks "yes, someone actually gets it."

**Toxic Positivity:** Framing genuinely hard experiences as opportunities or blessings.

**Example:** "Menopause is a beautiful transition into a new chapter of womanhood. Embrace the changes as your body enters this powerful phase."

**Fix:** Acknowledge the hard parts without trying to silver-lining them. "Menopause can be brutal. The sleep deprivation alone is enough to wreck your week. But there are things that actually help, not platitudes, real strategies."

## 4C. The Patronizing Pivot

**The Problem:** AI often acknowledges a difficulty, then immediately pivots to positivity without sitting with the difficulty.

**AI Pattern:** "While [hard thing] can be frustrating, the good news is that [positive thing]!"

**Fix:** Sometimes just acknowledge the hard thing. Full stop. The "good news" can come later, or in the next article, or never. Not every piece of content needs a silver lining.

---

# 5. HUMANIZATION STRATEGIES & TECHNIQUES

---

## 5A. Always Rewrite the Opening

Never publish an AI-generated first paragraph. The intro is where AI patterns are most concentrated and most obvious. Write it yourself or heavily rewrite it.

**Technique:** Write the entire piece with AI, then delete paragraphs 1-2. Start with what was paragraph 3. Often that's where the real content begins.

## 5B. Add First-Person Specificity

AI writes in generalizations. Humans write from specific experience.

**Before (AI):** "Many women find that their sleep quality decreases during perimenopause."

**After (Human):** "I used to sleep like a rock. Then I hit 44 and suddenly I was waking up at 3 AM drenched in sweat, every single night, for months."

**Technique:** After generating a draft, go through and add 2-3 first-person anecdotes or specific details per article. These don't have to be literally true personal experiences for brand content; they can be composite reader experiences drawn from community feedback, app data, or user interviews.

## 5C. Vary Your Rhythm

Read your content aloud. If it sounds like a metronome, it sounds like AI.

**Technique:**
- Follow a long sentence with a short one
- Follow three medium sentences with a single-word paragraph
- Break a long section with a one-line aside
- Use fragments intentionally: "Not ideal." "Worth a try." "Big difference."

## 5D. Be Specific, Not Generic

AI defaults to broad, widely applicable statements. Humans get specific.

**Before (AI):** "Exercise can help manage menopause symptoms."

**After (Human):** "A 20-minute walk after dinner cut my hot flash frequency in half within two weeks. Not a jog, not a HIIT session. Just a walk."

**Technique:** Replace every generic claim with a specific example, number, or scenario.

## 5E. Have Opinions

AI is allergic to taking a firm stance. Humans have opinions, preferences, and biases.

**Before (AI):** "There are many supplements that may help with menopause symptoms. It's important to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new regimen."

**After (Human):** "Black cohosh gets a lot of hype but the research is shaky at best. Magnesium, on the other hand, has solid evidence behind it for sleep and mood. Start there."

**Technique:** After generating, find every hedge and decide: commit to the position or cut the sentence entirely. Fence-sitting is the most AI thing you can do.

## 5F. Write Uneven Content

Human-written articles are messy. Some sections are longer than others. Some points get a full paragraph, others get a sentence. The piece doesn't feel perfectly balanced.

**Technique:** After generating, intentionally make it uneven:
- Expand one section way beyond the others because it's the most important
- Condense another section to a single sentence
- Add an aside or tangent that's only loosely related but adds personality
- Let the structure feel organic, not manufactured

## 5G. Use Conversational Devices

Humans use conversational tricks that AI rarely deploys well:

- **Rhetorical questions that aren't generic:** Not "Have you ever wondered about menopause?" but "Why does nobody warn you about the brain fog?"
- **Direct address:** "Look." "Here's what I'd actually do." "Forget everything you've heard about HRT for a second."
- **Informal connectors:** "Plus," "Also," "On top of that," "And honestly,"
- **Contractions:** Always use contractions. "Don't," "won't," "it's." Non-contracted forms ("do not," "will not," "it is") sound robotic.
- **Starting sentences with conjunctions:** "But," "And," "So" at the start of sentences sounds human.

## 5H. Add Imperfections

Human writing has deliberate imperfections that signal authenticity:

- A sentence fragment used for emphasis
- A parenthetical that's a little too long
- A paragraph that's one sentence
- A casual aside that breaks the fourth wall
- A self-correction: "Actually, let me rephrase that."
- Occasional colloquialisms: "game-changer" is AI, but "life-saver" used casually is human

## 5I. The "Delete and Read" Test

After editing, delete the title and byline. Read it cold. Ask:

1. Could you tell this was written by AI?
2. Does it sound like a real person with opinions wrote it?
3. Is there a single sentence that only a human would write?
4. Does any part make you feel something?

If you answer "no" to any of these, the piece needs more human editing.

# 6. MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT + CONTENT-TYPE MODULES

---

## 6A. Master System Prompt (Use for ALL Content)

Copy and paste this as your system prompt or the beginning of every content generation conversation:

```
VOICE & TONE RULES:
- Write like a smart, experienced friend who happens to know a lot about this topic. Not a textbook. Not a brand mascot. A real person.
- Use contractions always. Never write "do not" when "don't" works.
- Take positions. Have opinions. Commit to statements. Do not hedge with "may," "might," "could potentially," "it's possible that" unless citing genuinely uncertain research.
- Never use em dashes. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.
- Never start with a broad context-setting sentence ("In today's world...", "[Topic] is a common...", "[Topic] affects millions..."). Start specific. Start mid-thought. Start with a scene, a feeling, or a surprising fact.
- Do not end with a summary paragraph that restates the article. End on a forward-looking thought, a single action step, or just stop when you're done.
- Do not explain things the reader already knows. Assume competence.

STRUCTURE RULES:
- Vary paragraph lengths: 1-sentence paragraphs, 4-sentence paragraphs, mixed throughout.
- Vary sentence lengths: short punchy sentences (3-6 words) mixed with longer complex ones (20-30 words). Never write 4+ sentences of the same length in a row.
- Do not use perfectly parallel structure across sections. Make sections different lengths, different formats.
- Use headers sparingly. Not every sub-point needs a header.
- Do not default to listicle format. Use narrative, essay, Q&A, or myth-busting formats when appropriate.
- Never use the colon-to-bullet-list pattern more than once per piece.

```

## 6B. Blog / SEO Content Module

Add this AFTER the master prompt when generating blog content:

```
CONTENT TYPE: Blog / SEO Article

ADDITIONAL RULES:
- Target keyword should appear naturally, not forced. If it sounds awkward, rephrase the sentence.
- Write for the reader first, search engine second. If a keyword placement sounds robotic, skip it.
- H2s should be genuine section breaks, not keyword-stuffed mini-titles for every paragraph.
- Include internal links naturally where relevant.
- Meta description: Write it like a text message to a friend telling them why to read this. Not a formal summary.
- Aim for Flesch Reading Ease score of 65 or higher.
- The intro must hook in 2 sentences or less. No throat-clearing.
- Include at least one specific anecdote, number, or real-world example per section.

```

## 6C. Email Content Module

Add this AFTER the master prompt when generating emails:

```
CONTENT TYPE: Email (Newsletter / Nurture Sequence / Onboarding)

- First line must hook immediately. No "Hi [Name], hope you're doing well."
- Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences max. Emails are skimmed.
- One CTA per email. Not three. One.
- Write like you're emailing one person, not an audience.
- Conversational tone is more important here than anywhere else.
- End with a specific ask or a personal sign-off, not "Click here to learn more!"
- Pre-header text should complement the subject line, not repeat it.
```

## 6D. Social Media Content Module

Add this AFTER the master prompt when generating social posts:

```
CONTENT TYPE: Social Media (Facebook / LinkedIn)

ADDITIONAL RULES:
- First line is everything. It must stop the scroll. Lead with the most surprising, relatable, or provocative part.
- No hashtag walls. 3-5 relevant hashtags max on LinkedIn. 1-3 on Facebook.
- Write like you're posting on your personal account, not a brand account.
- Short paragraphs. Single sentences as paragraphs are fine and encouraged.
- Do not use the "hook → story → lesson → CTA" template for every post. Mix it up.
- Do not use emoji as bullet points (the 🔥✅💡 pattern is an instant AI tell).
- Use line breaks generously for readability.
- LinkedIn: Write for people who are scrolling during a boring meeting. Be interesting enough to make them stop.
- Facebook: Write for people scrolling before bed. Be relatable enough to make them comment.
- Avoid the "I did X. Here's what I learned:" template.
- Avoid numbered "thread-style" posts that feel manufactured.

# 7. SEO VS. VOICE RULES (CHANNEL-SPECIFIC)

---

## 7A. SEO Content: Where to Bend Voice Rules

SEO sometimes requires patterns that overlap with AI tells. Here's how to handle conflicts:

**Keyword Repetition:**
- AI detection concern: Repeating the same phrase feels robotic
- SEO need: Target keywords need to appear multiple times
- **Resolution:** Use the exact keyword 2-3 times. Use variations and related terms for the rest. Focus keyword density in headers, first paragraph, and meta description. Let the body breathe naturally.

**Header Structure:**
- AI detection concern: Too many headers looks over-structured
- SEO need: H2s and H3s help Google understand content hierarchy
- **Resolution:** Use H2s for genuine sections (4-6 per long-form article). Use H3s sparingly, only when a section truly has sub-points. Not every paragraph needs its own header.

**Content Length:**
- AI detection concern: Long, comprehensive posts can feel padded
- SEO need: Long-form content ranks well for competitive keywords
- **Resolution:** Length should come from depth and examples, not from restating points in different words. 2,000 words of insight beats 3,000 words of fluff.

**FAQ Sections:**
- AI detection concern: FAQ sections at the bottom often feel like AI filler
- SEO need: FAQ schema can win featured snippets
- **Resolution:** Only include FAQs if they answer genuinely different questions than the article body. Write answers conversationally, not formally. 2-3 sentence answers, not paragraphs.

## 7B. Social Media: Voice-First Rules

Social content has zero SEO constraints. Voice is everything.

- No keyword optimization needed. Write purely for engagement.
- No header structure needed. Just text.
- Length is determined by platform norms, not SEO.
- Personality and opinions matter more than comprehensiveness.
- A post that makes someone comment is worth more than a post that covers every angle.

## 7C. Email: Hybrid Rules

Email sits between SEO and social.

- Subject lines should be optimized for open rates (like headlines) but sound human.
- Body copy should prioritize readability and action over information density.
- Links should feel natural, not forced.
- No keyword stuffing. Nobody is searching inside your emails.

# 8. SOCIAL MEDIA FORMATTING TELLS (Facebook & LinkedIn)

---

## 8A. Formatting Patterns That Scream AI

| AI TELL | WHY IT'S OBVIOUS | HUMAN ALTERNATIVE |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Emoji bullet points (🔑 Point 1, 💡 Point 2, 🚀 Point 3) | Every AI LinkedIn post uses this format | Use plain text. If you must use emoji, use one type sparingly, not a different one per point. |
| Perfectly numbered lists (1. Point 2. Point 3. Point) | AI loves neat numbering for everything | Write in paragraphs. If listing, use casual numbering only when order matters. |
| Opening with "I [big claim]" + "Here's what I learned:" | The LinkedIn AI post template | Open with the insight itself, not the setup. |
| The exact pattern: Hook → Story → Lesson → CTA | Every AI post follows this. Every single one. | Mix up structure: sometimes story only, sometimes opinion only, sometimes question only. |
| Ending with "Agree? 👇" or "Thoughts? 💭" | Engagement-bait that everyone recognizes now | End with a genuine question or don't ask at all. |
| Three single-word sentences in a row ("Powerful. Impactful. Transformative.") | Feels like a Nike ad written by a robot | Write a real sentence. |
| Bold text on every other line | AI uses bold to create "scanability" artificially | Use bold for one key phrase per post max, or not at all. |
| Line break after every sentence | Creates that distinctive AI "staccato" rhythm | Group some sentences into short paragraphs. Not everything needs its own line. |
| Hashtag walls at the bottom (#menopause #womenshealth #wellness #perimenopause #hormones #healthyaging #selfcare #menopauseawareness) | 8+ hashtags in a neat row is a clear signal | 3-5 hashtags, mixed into the post or at the end. |

## 8B. Facebook-Specific Tells

- Overly polished language in a platform that rewards casual tone
- Stock-photo-style language: "Discover the power of..."
- Posts that read like press releases disguised as personal updates
- Excessive length without genuine depth (padded AI text)

**Fix:** Facebook rewards vulnerability, humor, and relatability. Write like you're posting to a group of friends who happen to be going through the same thing.

## 8C. LinkedIn-Specific Tells

- The "personal story with a business lesson" formula used on every post
- Overuse of "I" + humble-brag structure
- Artificial wisdom: "The best leaders know that..."
- The "hot take that isn't actually a hot take" format
- Ending every post with a question designed to boost engagement metrics

**Fix:** LinkedIn rewards genuine expertise and specific, useful insights. Share something you actually know that others don't. Skip the narrative wrapper if the insight is strong enough to stand alone.

# 9. AI HALLUCINATION RISKS IN HEALTH CONTENT

---

## 9A. Why This Is Critical for Your Content

AI can confidently state medical information that is:
- Outdated (based on old guidelines in training data)
- Fabricated (statistics, study results, or expert quotes that don't exist)
- Oversimplified (removing important caveats from medical nuance)
- Dangerously wrong (contraindications, drug interactions, dosage information)

Health misinformation in menopause content is especially dangerous because:
- Your audience may use your content to make treatment decisions
- Menopause research is rapidly evolving (especially around HRT)
- There's significant misinformation in the training data itself
- AI treats all sources equally, whether it's a peer-reviewed study or a wellness blog

## 9B. High-Risk Content Categories

**Verify EVERYTHING in these categories before publishing:**

1. **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):** Guidance has changed dramatically in recent years. AI may cite outdated WHI study conclusions or present old risk assessments as current.

2. **Supplement Claims:** AI will state supplement benefits with confidence that is not supported by evidence. Always check specific claims against current systematic reviews.

3. **Drug Interactions:** AI may not flag important interactions between menopause treatments and other medications.

4. **Statistics & Prevalence Data:** AI fabricates statistics. Any number, percentage, or "studies show" claim must be independently verified.

5. **Expert Quotes:** AI invents quotes and attributes them to real doctors and researchers. Never publish a quote you haven't verified.

6. **Dosage Information:** Never publish AI-generated dosage recommendations without medical review.

7. **Diagnostic Criteria:** AI may present outdated or incorrect diagnostic criteria for perimenopause, menopause, or related conditions.

## 9C. Fact-Checking Protocol

For every piece of health content:

1. **Flag all medical claims.** Any statement about symptoms, treatments, causes, or outcomes needs a source.

2. **Verify statistics.** Search for the original study or source. If you can't find it, the AI may have fabricated it. Remove the statistic.

3. **Check recency.** Medical guidelines change. Verify that any cited research or guideline is still current.

4. **Verify quotes and attributions.** If the AI attributes a statement to a specific doctor or researcher, verify the quote exists.

5. **Add disclaimers where appropriate.** "Talk to your doctor" isn't just legal protection; it's genuinely responsible content.

6. **Have a medical reviewer.** Ideally, a healthcare professional reviews health content before publication.

## 9D. Prompt Safeguards

Add to your prompt when generating health content:

```
HEALTH CONTENT SAFEGUARDS:
- Do not fabricate statistics, study results, or expert quotes. If you're not confident in a specific number, say "research suggests" without inventing a figure.
- Do not provide specific dosage recommendations for any supplement or medication.
- Do not present treatment information as universally applicable. Always note that individual situations vary and professional guidance matters.
- Flag any claim you're less than highly confident about with [VERIFY] so the editor knows to fact-check it.
- Do not cite specific studies unless you can provide the actual study title and authors. If you can't, present the information as general knowledge without a fake citation.
- When discussing HRT, note that guidelines have evolved significantly and direct readers to current resources.
```

# 10. BEFORE/AFTER EXAMPLES

---

## 10A. Blog Introduction (Menopause-Specific)

**BEFORE (AI):**
"Menopause is a natural biological process that every woman will eventually experience. While it marks the end of a woman's reproductive years, it also brings a range of physical and emotional symptoms that can significantly impact daily life. Understanding these symptoms is the first step toward managing them effectively. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the most common menopause symptoms and provide evidence-based strategies for finding relief."

**AFTER (Human):**
"Nobody told me about the rage. The hot flashes, sure. The night sweats, fine. But the sudden, white-hot anger over nothing? The crying at dog food commercials? That part got left out of every pamphlet I ever read. Turns out, mood changes are one of the most common menopause symptoms, and one of the least talked about. So let's talk about it."

**What changed:** Removed generic opening, added first-person specificity, started with emotional honesty instead of a textbook definition, created immediate relatability, removed "comprehensive guide" framing.

## 10B. Blog Body Section (Menopause-Specific)

**BEFORE (AI):**
"Hot flashes are one of the most prevalent symptoms of menopause, affecting approximately 75% of women during this transitional period. These vasomotor symptoms are characterized by sudden feelings of warmth, typically in the upper body, face, and neck. They can last anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes and may be accompanied by sweating, heart palpitations, and a feeling of anxiety. While the exact cause of hot flashes is not fully understood, they are believed to be related to changes in the hypothalamus, the body's temperature-regulating center, as estrogen levels decline."

**AFTER (Human):**
"About 3 in 4 women get hot flashes during menopause. If you're reading this, you probably don't need me to describe what they feel like. But here's what's actually useful to know: they're triggered by your hypothalamus basically short-circuiting as estrogen drops. Your brain thinks you're overheating when you're not, and sends your body into cool-down mode. Sweat, flushing, racing heart, the whole thing. That's why cooling strategies work, and why stress (which also messes with your thermostat) makes them worse."

**What changed:** Removed clinical distance, acknowledged reader's existing knowledge, explained the "why" instead of just the "what," used conversational tone while keeping accuracy, cut unnecessary definitions.

## 10C. Email Subject + Opening (Menopause-Specific)

**BEFORE (AI):**
Subject: "5 Evidence-Based Strategies for Managing Menopause Symptoms"
Body: "Hi there! We hope this email finds you well. Menopause is a significant life transition, and we understand that navigating its many symptoms can feel overwhelming. That's why we've put together this helpful guide with five proven strategies to help you feel your best during this important time."

**AFTER (Human):**
Subject: "the 3am wake-up call nobody asked for"
Body: "Up again last night? Same. Here's what actually moved the needle for me on sleep: cutting caffeine after noon (annoying but it works), keeping the bedroom at 65 degrees, and magnesium glycinate before bed. Not a cure, but the difference between 3 hours of sleep and 6."

**What changed:** Subject line sounds like a text message, not a headline. No filler greeting. Immediate value. First-person experience. Specific and actionable. No hollow empathy.

## 10D. Social Media Post (Menopause-Specific, Facebook)

**BEFORE (AI):**
"🌸 Navigating menopause can feel overwhelming, but you don't have to do it alone! 💪

Here are 5 ways to manage hot flashes naturally:

🔥 Stay hydrated
🧊 Keep your bedroom cool
🧘 Practice deep breathing
🥗 Eat a balanced diet
💤 Prioritize sleep

Remember, every woman's journey is unique. You've got this! 🌟

#menopause #womenshealth #hotflashes #perimenopause #wellness #healthyliving #menopauseawareness #selfcare"

**AFTER (Human):**
"Okay but why did nobody tell me that spicy food would become my personal enemy after 45

I used to eat hot wings for fun. Now a jalapeño sends me into a full-body meltdown at the dinner table.

Turns out certain foods are hot flash triggers and spicy food is top of the list. Other sneaky ones: red wine (sorry), coffee (double sorry), and super hot drinks in general.

Since I started tracking my triggers in an app, I've cut my hot flash frequency roughly in half. Not by giving up everything good in life, just by knowing which things set me off on which days.

What's your worst trigger food? I need to know I'm not the only one mourning hot sauce.

#menopause #hotflashes #perimenopause"

**What changed:** Removed emoji bullet points, removed empowerment fluff, added personal voice and humor, made it relatable instead of prescriptive, natural CTA through genuine question, 3 hashtags instead of 8.

## 10E. Generic Blog Introduction (Non-Health)

**BEFORE (AI):**
"In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, content marketing has become an indispensable tool for businesses of all sizes. As we navigate an ever-changing marketplace, the ability to create compelling, engaging content has never been more crucial. This comprehensive guide will delve into the key strategies that can help you elevate your content marketing efforts and drive meaningful results."

**AFTER (Human):**
"Most content marketing advice is recycled garbage. Write great content. Be consistent. Know your audience. Thanks, I'm cured. Here's what actually works in practice, based on spending $400K on content last year and tracking every piece."

**What changed:** Removed every AI buzzword, started with an opinion, led with credibility through specificity, cut the generic context-setting.

## 10F. Generic Product Description (Non-Health)

**BEFORE (AI):**
"Our innovative platform leverages cutting-edge technology to provide a seamless, intuitive user experience. With our comprehensive suite of robust features, you can streamline your workflow, optimize your productivity, and unlock your full potential. Our tailored solutions are designed to meet the unique needs of modern professionals."

**AFTER (Human):**
"It's a tracking app. You log your symptoms, it shows you patterns over time. The dashboard tells you what's getting better, what's getting worse, and what might be connected. Setup takes about 2 minutes."

**What changed:** Replaced every buzzword with plain description of what the product actually does. Traded grandiose promises for honest clarity.

# 11. PROTECTED TERMS (Do Not Flag as AI)

---

These words and phrases are legitimate and necessary in your content. They may overlap with patterns seen in AI writing, but they serve a real purpose in your context.

## 11A. Clinical / Medical Terms (Keep When Accurate)

These are proper medical terminology and should be used when precision matters:

- Perimenopause, menopause, post-menopause
- Vasomotor symptoms (when speaking to HCPs or citing research)
- Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol
- HRT / MHT (menopausal hormone therapy)
- Endometrium, ovarian, adrenal
- Osteoporosis, cardiovascular, cognitive
- Bioidentical, transdermal, systemic
- Contraindicated, dosage, titration
- Comorbidity, etiology, pathophysiology (in clinical contexts only)

**Rule:** Use plain language first, clinical terms when precision requires it. "Hot flashes" over "vasomotor symptoms" in consumer content. "Vasomotor symptoms" when citing a specific study or talking to healthcare providers.

## 11B. Empathetic Language (Keep When Genuine)

The goal is not to eliminate warmth, but to eliminate fake warmth.

**KEEP (genuine empathy):**
- "That sounds really frustrating" (when responding to a specific situation)
- "You're not imagining it" (validating a specific experience)
- "This is a real thing, not just in your head"
- Describing symptoms accurately enough that the reader feels seen
- Acknowledging difficulty without immediately solving it

**AVOID (performative empathy):**
- "We understand how challenging this can be"
- "You deserve to feel your best"
- "You're not alone in this journey"
- "We're here for you every step of the way"
- Any empathy statement that could apply to literally any health condition

**The test:** If you could swap the health condition and the sentence still works, it's too generic. "We understand how challenging [diabetes / anxiety / menopause / back pain] can be" = generic. "The brain fog is real, and no, it's not just stress or aging" = specific to your audience.

## 11C. Evidence-Based Phrasing (Keep When Citing Real Research)

These phrases are necessary when referencing actual research. They are only AI tells when used without a source.

**KEEP (with real sources):**
- "Research suggests..." (when you link to or name the actual research)
- "A 2024 study in The Lancet found..." (specific citation)
- "According to the North American Menopause Society..."
- "Current guidelines recommend..." (with link to guidelines)
- "Evidence supports..." (when referencing specific evidence)

**AVOID (without sources):**
- "Studies show..." (which studies?)
- "Research indicates..." (what research?)
- "Experts recommend..." (which experts?)
- "Science suggests..." (be specific)
- "It's well-established that..." (established by whom?)

**Rule:** If you can't name the source, don't use the evidence-based framing. Either find the source or present it as general knowledge without the academic wrapper.
